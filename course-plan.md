# CSC 591 Directed Studies in Distributed Ledger Technology

© 2020 Jon Healy and Sean Chester

## Over-arching Goal

Blockchain is an emerging, disruptive technology with potential to impact every sector of the economy, from supply chain management (private ledgers) to currency itself (public ledgers). Disruptive technologies generally lead to vast, unanticipated research challenges, and there is no reason to expect blockchain to be different in this regard. The goal of this directed study is to uncover several particularly exciting concrete examples of these challenges, especially ones that are scoped similar to a typical Master's thesis and relate to scalability.

This CSC 591 study will achieve the aforementioned goal by means of a _focused literature analysis_ with a simultaneous emphasis on coverage, analytical depth, and synthesis to identify themes. The depth and synthesis, in particular, should expose research gaps and new scientific hypotheses.

## Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO's)

In pursuing the over-arching goal, there are several basic research skills that should be developed and refined. These form the _ILO's_ and indicate the level to which a literature analysis like this could be repeated independently by Jon, without requiring direction, when other exciting, disruptive technologies emerge. Namely, we seek to develop the following four research skills in this course:

  O1) Identifying the most relevant research papers (or similar scientific artefacts), and explaining literature search methodology
  O2) Comprehending and critiquing the merits and shortcomings of research papers, and summarising key contributions and the critique effectively
  O3) Synthesising multiple research papers in order to extract larger trends, themes, and omissions within the research community
  O4) Identifying research gaps and transforming them into concrete, well-formulated scientific hypotheses

## Structure and Approach

This literature analysis will be conducted over six two-week cycles from 10-Jan-2020 until 2-Apr-2020 (excluding Reading Break, 13-17 Feb). Each cycle will add contribution to an ongoing report, which will be submitted on the last Tuesday and evaluated on the last Thursday of that cycle. The intermediate Thursday will be used for an informal status update. _LaTeX_ source for the report, including a _Bibtex_ bibliography file, will be maintained in a shared _git_ repository, allowing for an easy _diff_ of report versions between cycles.

Towards O1, Jon will select the papers subject to partial direction from Sean. After every second cycle, we will co-redefine the principle direction of interest in the paper selection.

After the final cycle, the cumulative findings will be presented in an oral presentation.

## Evaluation

The course is split into two components: the written report and the oral presentation, worth 90 % and 10 %, respectively. The evaluation criteria for the oral presentation will be co-established in the first week of March.

The evaluation for the written report will be split evenly across cycles, with 15 % of the total course mark awarded on each final Thursday. In alignment with the ILO's described above, evaluation of the report will be subject to the following rubric. Note that a paper is assigned to the cycle in which it is added; it is possible to improve the score for cycle _i_ in cycle _i+j_ by improving the discussion of papers from cycle _i_ during the submission for cycle _i+j_; however, it is not possible to add new papers to a previous cycle.
