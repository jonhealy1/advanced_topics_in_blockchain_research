#### An Introductory Analysis of Some of the Major Ideas Surrounding Blockchain Consensus  

For better or worse, the introduction of Bitcoin helped change the way that many people see and interact with the world. (Bitcoin was first formalized in the Bitcoin white paper which was published on October 31, 2008.) With the publication of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, the idea of a blokchain was born and value could be established on a digital network for the first time. On a blockchain, digital assets can be created and assigned to individuals who can trust that no one can access or spend their assets without acquiring their private keys. The author of the Bitcoin white paper - Satoshi Nakamoto - famously solved what was called the 'double-spending problem' in a network without centralized control. If Alice sends Bob $10 in digital tokens and tries to send Carl the same $10 in tokens only one of the transactions should count. In a blockchain there can even be one block where Bob receives the $10 from Alice and another block where Carl receives the $10 but by design only one of these blocks will be voted as valid via the longest chain rule and incorporated into the blockchain. This introduces the idea of consensus. The network at large must come to a consensus regarding the total state of all value in the system. To reach consensus the network must choose a node to validate a round of transactions and assemble them into a block. In Bitcoin this is done through something called 'proof-of-work'. Nodes dedicated to becoming validators compete by assembling transactions into a block so that the block that they propose is valid. To finalize this process they use computing power to hash their proposed block with a value containing a specified number of leading zeroes. If a node is succesful - if other nodes in the system agree that the new block belongs on the larger blockchain - the succesful node is awarded a specified amount of currency along with any transaction costs that Users have added to their transactions for faster processing consideration. (The value created by validating blocks is also the only source of inflation in the system.)  

The publication of the Bitcoin white paper ushered in a new era for digital finance but many of the ideas that are introduced in this paper find their genesis in other work. Most people realize that Bitcoin would not be succesful without previous advances in cryptography. There are other ideas as well introduced by Bitcoin that were developed elsewhere. Concerning consensus, the Hashcash paper written by Adam Back introduced the concept of proof-of-work as a means of creating security and helping to stop spam by requring senders of email to compute cryptographic puzzles. This report will be looking at consensus as it relates to blockahins existing on public peer-to-peer networks. To achieve this we will be looking at Bitcoin then examining proof-of-work more closely by travelling back in time to look at Hashcash. From there we will travel back into the future beyond Bitcoin at what is now the world's second most valuable blockcahin network, Ethereum. The two papers we will look at with respect to Ethereum are the Ethereum white paper published in ---- and the Ethereum yellow paper published later in ---- as a more formal explanation of how the Ethereum network works. Ethereum is maybe most well known for implementing a Turing complete programming language on top of a Bitcoin like blockchain. Another important dsi
