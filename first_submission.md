#### An Introductory Analysis of Some of the Major Ideas Surrounding Blockchain Consensus  

For better or worse, the introduction of Bitcoin helped change the way that many people see and interact with the world. (Bitcoin was first formalized in the Bitcoin white paper which was published on October 31, 2008.) With the publication of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, the idea of a blokchain was born and value could be established on a digital network for the first time. On a blockchain, digital assets can be created and assigned to individuals who can trust that no one can access or spend their assets without acquiring their private keys. The author of the Bitcoin white paper - Satoshi Nakamoto - famously solved what was called the 'double-spending problem'. If Alice sends Bob $10 in digital tokens and tries to send Carl the same $10 in tokens only one of the transactions should count. In a blockchain there can even be one block where Bob receives the $10 from Alice and another block where Carl receives the $10 but by design only one of these blocks will be voted as valid via the longest chain rule and incorporated into the blockchain. This introduces the idea of consensus. The network at large must come to a consensus regarding the total state of all value in the system. To reach consensus the network must choose a node to validate a round of transactions and assemble them into a block. In Bitcoin this is done through something called 'proof-of-work'. Nodes dedicated to becoming validators compete by assembling transactions into a block so that the block that they propose is valid and fits into the blockchain. To finalize this process they use computing power to hash their proposed block with a value containing a specified number of leading zeroes. If a node is succesful - if other nodes in the system agree that the new block belongs on the larger blockchain - the succesful node is awarded a specified amount of currency along with any transaction costs that Users have added to their transactions for faster processing consideration.
