Blockchain: An enabler for healthcare and life sciences transformation

- blockchain - "ideal technology to support major requirements for emerging healthcare and life sciences (HCLS) trends." 
- secure exchange of health data
    - data integrity
    - provenance
    - patient/owner consent
    - privacy
    - audit trail

- healthcare providers, payers ie insurance companies
- paper focuses on the use of blockchain for data exchange across healthecosystem

- use cases:
    - patient/ owner mediated health data exchange
    - outcome-based contracts
    - clinical trial data exchange
    - exchanges for medical claimes and payments
    - pharma supply chain
    - etc.

- case study: genomics data exchange

4 facets of blockchain identified - Hyperledger
- 1. shared ledger - chaining blocks
- 2. consensus:
    - plug and play in HL
    - default: PBFT - Practical Byzantin Faukt Tolerance
        - PBFT: used in permissioned networks
- 3. built in privacy and security models
    - public/private key
    - privacy by key-based access controls 
- 4. smart contracts: business logic invoked with transactions comitted on the ledger
    - can record chain of custody of data access and exchange 
    - similar to stored procedures in db

- HIPAA-enabled:
    - each node needs to run in an HIPAA-enabled environment
    - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
    - could also run in HIPAA cloud 
    - 

- Use cases:
    - healthcare data exchange
    - payments
    - clinical trials
    - pharmaceutical supply chain

- data:
    - all EHR electronic health record online 
    - personal genomics data increasingly available
    - exogenous data: consumer grade wearable devices and data related to social determinants of health 
    - 
- reguations demand that data be available to patients on request and others by consent - problem: so much data
