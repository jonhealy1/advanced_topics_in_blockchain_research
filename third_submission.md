Relative to other large technology companies, IBM has been fairly active in the blockchain space. Their dedication to blockchain is reflected in a number of papers that have been published in the IBM Journal of Research and Development. This report will look at four such papers, all published in 2019. 

Probably the most active area of development within IBM related to blockchain is contained in the Hyperledger project. Hyperledger is an open source, cross-industry collaboration hosted by the Linux Foundation. IBM was one of the pioneers of this initiative and their stamp is most notably seen on Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric is a plug and play blockchain solution and is the framework behind IBM's blockchain platform. Components in Fabric like consensus and memebership services can be replaced and it is Fabric's modular architecture which has helped the project garner a considerable amount of attention. 

Unlike public blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric is meant to be deployed in a permissioned, semi-trusted environment. Fabric is seen as a good solution for cross-industry applications like bank to bank financial services. In an environment like this you have participants that may not completely trust each other with concerns relating to privacy, accountability and security. Only semi-trusted entities approved by other members in the network would be allowed to join and view their shared ledger or blockchain. Permissioned blockchain solutions are ideal for these types of scenarios and the benefits of using a dedicated blockchain platform can not likely be replicated in a shared database type of solution. 

One widely talked about use case for permissioned blockchains like IBM's Hyperledger Fabric relates to the area of supply chain management. Putting a class of products on a blockchain like say diamonds may have different requirements than those involved with bank to bank financial services. A supply chain blockchain may be publicly viewable as consumer's have an interest in the authenticity of a product. Bank to bank transactions would only be viewable by other banks and maybe some government auditing agencies. One paper that will be looked at here relates directly to the issue of supply chain management with a focus on automating what they call high-volume tasks involving reconciliations, payments, and settlements [1].

Another notable use case for blockchain technology that has received some attention is in the distriibution of health care data. Privacy concerns here are much more stringent than those invovled with supply chain management. Health care data needs to be treated with the utmost care and concern and a person's health care records should only be viewable by trusted care providers. These trusted care providers should additionally only be allowed to view the portion of an individual's health care record that directly relates to any condition that is being examined. Ideally access would be time managed and not available to a health care provider after a treatment has finished. Using cryptography a patient can digitally sign transactions that allow a provider temporary access to a portion of their medical history. Securing health care data on IBM's Hyperledger Fabric solution is looke at carefully in [3] and this is another paper being covered here. 

A blockchain is essentially a provenance solution. It stores the history of all transactions in a network whether we are talking about currency with Bitcoin or recording when a diamond was mined in South Africa using something like Hyperledger Fabric. Blockchains depending on their use case can potentially contain enormous amounts of valuable data. Examining a blockchain may lead to things like identifying issues in supply chains. Blockchains and analytics go hand in hand because data put into a blockchain needs to be specificially formatted. Tools relating to analytics using artificial intelleigence is covered in another paper [2] being reviewed here. 

and because of this blockchains have been
