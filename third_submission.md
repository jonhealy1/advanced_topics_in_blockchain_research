1. Introduction

Relative to other large technology companies, IBM has been fairly active in the blockchain space. Their dedication to blockchain is reflected in a number of papers that have been published in the IBM Journal of Research and Development. This report will look at four such papers, all published in 2019. 

Probably the most active area of development within IBM related to blockchain is contained in the Hyperledger project. Hyperledger is an open source, cross-industry collaboration hosted by the Linux Foundation. IBM was one of the pioneers of this initiative and their stamp is most notably seen on Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric is a plug and play blockchain solution and is the framework behind IBM's blockchain platform. Components in Fabric like consensus and memebership services can be replaced and it is Fabric's modular architecture which has helped the project garner a considerable amount of attemtion. 

Unlike public blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric is meant to be deployed in a permissioned, semi-trusted environment. Fabric is seen as good solution for cross-industry applications like bank to bank financial services.
